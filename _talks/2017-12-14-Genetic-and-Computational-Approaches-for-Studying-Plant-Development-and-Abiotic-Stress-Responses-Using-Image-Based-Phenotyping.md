Here, I discussed methods that I have used for genomic prediction and genome wide association mapping for longitudinal traits. The methods are discussed in detail in [Campbell et al (2015)](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/168/4/1476), [Campbell et al (2017)](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/tpg/articles/10/2/plantgenome2016.07.0064), and [Campbell et al (2018)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/11/319897).
