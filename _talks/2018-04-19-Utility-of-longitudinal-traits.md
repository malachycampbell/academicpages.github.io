This presentation discussed the my current research in genomic prediction with Gota Morota, and some previous work on a two-step functional GWAS approach. The details of the methods discussed in this talk are outlined in [Campbell et al (2017)](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/tpg/articles/10/2/plantgenome2016.07.0064) and [Campbell et al (2018)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/11/319897).
