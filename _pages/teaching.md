## [Advanced Statistics and Experimental Design](http://malachycampbell.github.io/teaching/2020-AdvStats)
This course was taught as part of a NSF Digital Plant Science Initiative. It was designed to give first or second year graduate students from a variety of backgrounds (plant science, food science, engineering, and computer science) an overview of statisical analyses and experimental designs that are commonly used in plant science.

## [GWAS workshop @ VT](http://malachycampbell.github.io/teaching/2019-VT-GWAS-workshop)

This was a three day workshop that was taught with Gota Morota and Haipeng Yu at Virginia Tech. The workshop was intended to give students an introduction to running GWAS in R. It covers genotyping quality control, single marker regression, whole genome regression, and advanced topics for GWAS on multidimensional datasets. The link above provides access to the course materials for the sections I taught.

## [Statistical Methods for Omics Assisted Breeding](http://malachycampbell.github.io/teaching/2018-Omics-Assisted-Breeding)

This was a three day workshop that provided an introduction to quantitative genetics and taught participants how to leverage omics datasets for GWAS and genomic prediction. It was taught by Hiroyoshi Iwata, Gota Morota, Jessica Tressou, Diego Jarquin, Emi Tanaka, and myself. The link above provides access to the course materials for the sections I taught.
