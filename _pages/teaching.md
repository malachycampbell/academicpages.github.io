## [GWAS workshop @ VT](http://malachycampbell.github.io/teaching/2019-VT-GWAS-workshop.md)

This was a three day workshop that was taught with Gota Morota and Haipeng Yu at Virginia Tech. The workshop was intended to give students an introduction to running GWAS in R. It covers genotyping quality control, single marker regression, whole genome regression, and advanced topics for GWAS on multidimensional datasets. The link above provides access to the course materials for the sections I taught.
