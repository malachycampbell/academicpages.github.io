Utilizing Longitudinal Phenotypes Derived from High Throughput Phenotyping to Study and Improve Adaptation to Water Limitation in Rice	Invited Conference Talk	Utilizing-Longitudinal-Phenotypes	Gordon Research Conference - Salt and Water Stress in Plants (2018)	2018-06-07	Waterville Valley, New Hampshire	http://example2.com	Here I presented a study where we applied the random regression genomic prediction approach to select accessions with contrasting drought responses for high-resolution phenotyping.

Allelic variants of <i>OsHKT1;1</i> underlie the divergence between Indica and Japonica subspecies of rice for root sodium content	Invited Conference Talk	Allelic-variants-of-OsHKT11-underlie-the-divergence-between-Indica-and-Japonica-subspecies-of-rice-for-root-sodium-content	Nebraska Plant Breeding Symposium 2017	2017-03-14	Lincoln, Nebraska	http://example2.com	This is a presentation summarising the results of the PLoS Genetics paper where we identified <i>HKT1;1</i> as a major regulator of natural variation for root sodium conent.
