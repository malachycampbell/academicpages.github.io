2017-06-05	Allelic variants of <i>OsHKT1;1<\i> underlie the divergence between <i>indica<\i> and <i>japonica<\i> subspecies of rice (<i>Oryza sativa<\i>) for root sodium content	PLoS Genetics	<i>HKT1;1<\i> was identified as a major regualtor of root sodium content in rice. Variants that influence the transport of sodium were found to be a component of the divergence between to two subspecies of rice for root sodium content.	"Campbell, M.T., N. Bandillo, F.R.A.
