title: "Leveraging genome-enabled growth models to study shoot growth responses to water deficit in rice"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2019-07-05-CGM
excerpt: 'We used a novel, genome-enabled growth model that integrates genome-wide SNP markers and empirical data derived from image-based phenotyping platforms to jointly model water use and shoot biomass trajectories. We show that there is a trade-off between early vigor and drought tolerance, and identify an aquaporin gene, OsPIP1;1, as a potential candidate that regulates the timing of shoot growth responses to water deficit.'

We used a novel, genome-enabled growth model that integrates genome-wide SNP markers and empirical data derived from image-based phenotyping platforms to jointly model water use and shoot biomass trajectories. We show that there is a trade-off between early vigor and drought tolerance, and identify an aquaporin gene, OsPIP1;1, as a potential candidate that regulates the timing of shoot growth responses to water deficit.
