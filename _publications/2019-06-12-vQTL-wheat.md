excerpt: 'We applied variance-heterogeneity GWAS to identify several loci associated with grain cadmium concentration in bread wheat. Moreover, we showed that several of the vQTL loci were involved in pairwise interactions with other vQTL loci, indicating that epistasis may underlie differences in variance heterogeniety.'

We applied variance-heterogeneity GWAS to identify several loci associated with grain cadmium concentration in bread wheat. Moreover, we showed that several of the vQTL loci were involved in pairwise interactions with other vQTL loci, indicating that epistasis may underlie differences in variance heterogeniety.
