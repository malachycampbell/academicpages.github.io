We sought to apply random regression models to forecast shoot growth trajectories using B-splines and Legendre polynomials in well-watered and water-limited conditions under various longitudinal cross-validation scenarios. We showed that the frequency of phenotypic evaluation can be reduced without impacting prediction accuracy.
