excerpt: 'The differences between the subspecies of rice has been extensively studied at the morphological and genetic levels, however few studies have examined how these subspecies diverge at the transcriptional level. Here, we provide a comprehensive comparison of transcriptome diversity within cultivated rice and document the cis regulatory divergence between Indica and Japonica. To date, this is the largest collection of rice transcriptomes.'

The differences between the subspecies of rice has been extensively studied at the morphological and genetic levels, however few studies have examined how these subspecies diverge at the transcriptional level. Here, we provide a comprehensive comparison of transcriptome diversity within cultivated rice and document the cis regulatory divergence between <i>Indica</i> and <i>Japonica</i>. To date, this is the largest collection of rice transcriptomes.
